# Bookshelf API

This is a backend API project developed for the "Belajar Membuat Aplikasi Back-End untuk Pemula" course at Dicoding. The Bookshelf API allows users to store, retrieve, update, and delete books. It's important to note that this API only stores data in a list, not in a database or server.

## Features
- **Store Book**: Add new books to the list.
- **Get All Books**: Retrieve a list of all books stored in the list.
- **Get Book Detail**: Get detailed information about a specific book.
- **Update Book**: Update information about a book in the list.
- **Delete Book**: Remove a book from the list.

## Technologies Used
- Node.js v20.11.0
